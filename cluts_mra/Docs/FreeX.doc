FreeX v1.0
===========

(c) 1999 by Mauro Panigada

Sometimes you find a program in your c directory but you can not say where you
have given it... nor who written that program if there is no documentation
and in the ascii dump of file does not appear interesting strings...

My FreeX is based on output of Free, unknown author. FreeX gives information
about free space on a device and if it is OFS, FFS, simply DOS or what, the
name of volume... just run it and see.
