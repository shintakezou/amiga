ReadDevice 37.1
===============

(c) 1999 by Mauro Panigada

ReadDevice.a replaces ReadDevice.c by ...
It shows information, the same you can see in a mountlist of a device.
Remember that you have to write the device name without ":" at the end.
I do not know if all the information are right, verify yourself if you
think it could be useful.
