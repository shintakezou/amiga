RequestModeID 39.1
===================

(c) 1999 by Mauro Panigada

RequestString, RequestFile, RequestChoice, what is lost? Request ... ?
So RequestModeID is born: to fill the list of Request-- programs.
Really, some program needs a magic number for the resolution of their
screen. This number is the ModeID. Before this one, I have to read in
graphics include file, now it exists RequestModeID. When I finished it,
I never needed it again!
Enjoy yourself.
