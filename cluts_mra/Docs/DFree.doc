DFree v1.2
===========

(c) 1999 by Mauro Panigada

DFree show free work space on a device in bytes, kilo or mega, according to
the amount of free space.
As the Reboot tools, it is a short and better (!) translation from C source
code by Max Francis. See also my FreeX and the source header (DFree2) for
more. The usage, as you can think, is so easy that I do not spend many time
explaining it...
