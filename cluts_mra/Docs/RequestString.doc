RequestString 39.2
===================

(c) 1999 by Mauro Panigada

RequestString replaces the Thomas Kessler's RequestString. Mine is better:
is shorter and so on. I do not remember what, but something does not work well

to use, just try

 1> RequestString ?

Need Operating System 37, 68020+ and reqtools.library, as TK's version.
