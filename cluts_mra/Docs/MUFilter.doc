MUFilter v1.0
=============

(c) 1999 by Mauro Panigada

MUFilter is my first commodity program. It allows you (great effort!) to modify
the status of the filter of your Amiga. When you run it the first time, it pops up
and show you two boolean (checkbox) gadgets. The ghosted one should allow you
to lock the status of the filter, so that other programs can not modify it.
This does not work, now... Click on the other one, you will see light coming and
going or going and coming. Not so useful, however it exists.
When you close the window through close gadget, MUFilter is really still alive.
Call Commodity Exchange to see it in its list. To kill it you only have one
way: select it and click on KILL gadget of cx tool. Use ENABLE/DISABLE to enable
or disable MUFilter (quite the same of acting on checkbox gadget...)
