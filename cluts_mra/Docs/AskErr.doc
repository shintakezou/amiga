AskErr v1.0
===========

(c) 1999 by Mauro Panigada

AskErr is a simple, very short CLI/Shell utility that allow you to know the
error string associated with an error number.

For example:

 1> AskErr 205
 object not found
 1> AskErr 206
 invalid window description

Of course, typing "AskErr ?" you will have the template, but it is so easy!!!
