Where's XCom?
=============

You will find the AmigaGuide and text doc of `XCom`, butâ€¦ where's the
source?

`XCom`'s original name was `clcom` (clone comment, I suppose).

You can find it [here](../stores/AsmSources/clcom273.a).

Now you can read the obsolete [ReadMe.First](ReadMe.First). Don't
forget that all the email addresses you see in the original old files
are gone: ignore them.
