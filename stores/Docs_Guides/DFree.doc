	I am the Knight of Shortness.
	I am a bird I can fly.
	I love assembler.

	Therefore when I see a in concepts simple program too long
according to me (about 5k!), I decide to write it ex novo. Basing on
the original if there is a source code, or on the output and actions.

	So you can find a better doc in DFree by Max Francis.

	Very simple to be used: it is enough to specify a device, and
you will see an output. The precise length is unuseful to understand
how much space exist on a disk. So the free space, the result given,
is put in k, M or G bytes.
