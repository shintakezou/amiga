ATTENTION! ACHTUNG!

Running this your computer will reset suddenly.
Save all you want to save before.

To know the sense of this program, search for MF (Max Francis) Tools.
There he explains why this exists.

My own assembly version, of course, is shorter, but does the same thing.
Ehi Max, learn assembly and trash your C (I think it can be do better
also with a better C, not in style but I say the compiler...)


Reboot
======

ATTENTION, but not so fast (slow down)

It does the same thing, but with comfirmation...
