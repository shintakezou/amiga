                                ===========

	It requires OS2.0+.

	This program is useful in script files, when the users
must decide something about an operation, or only to ask a "advice"
to the user. So it replace the ask command in a intuitioned way.

	The syntax is:

	Askq TEXT [GADGETS] [TITLE] [VAR]

	TEXT must be given. The default gadgets given will be
"Yes|No" and the title will be "Request". The answer will be stored
in a var, default var is AskqAnswer. Remember always that the last
gadget on the right is the 0, then from the first gadget on the left
to the gadget on the left of the last, the gadgets will be 1,2,3...
IE from left to right: 1,2,3,4...n,0
This is a strange thing of EasyRequestArgs.

	The GADGETS will be divided by using |. If in TEXT,
GADGETS text or TITLE appear spaces, you have to put the " at the
beginning of the argument and close (") it when that argument is finished.

	Example:

	Askq "Am I a great programmer?" "No!!| Rotten | Stupid | Dai baka" "To be or not to be"

	In the specified VAR or in the default, Askq will store
the gadget number (see above).

	Really the result will be put also in d0, but I think it is
more useful in a envar.

	Enjoy yourself.
