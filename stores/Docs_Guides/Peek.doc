What?

	Do you remember old little Spectrum or C=64? (I remember my little
Spectrum 48k, when I was younger, I mean I was 8-years-old, why not?).
Now, yes it exists a better Peek and a Poke, given somewhere. So skip this
as program, if you want (and if you need) use only the source code.

	What can you learn? That it is unuseful doing unuseful thing.
I said something wrong (now I long for yesterday?)... Why not?

	"We must try to shake it down, do our best to break the ground,
try to turn the world around, one more time. Yes we ...." (CS)

	This explain, I hope, why I wrote this. No: it was only an
exercise. Interesting. Why not?

	Type "Peek ?" and enjoy yourself with this little silly tool.=
