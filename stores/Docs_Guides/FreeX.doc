Too easy to be explaned!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Just type it, you'll see what happens. Simply you now know
some information about a volume-device. Try with "FreeX ?" for a DOS-like
help (DEVICE: ). Specify it or not: default is sys: ... A tipical output:


	Volume name:  Workbench
	Filesystem:   FFS
	Total blocks: 42118
	Free blocks:  3615
	Total bytes:  21564416
	Free bytes:   1850880


	The idea is not mine. I found a program, called "Free" which
gave the same informations (not in the same order, and it used the bold
for the volume name) but it was too long. So I decided to rewrite it into
assembler, ATTENTION: without original sources, and I did NOT resourced
it. Simply I was looking at the output: that's all.

	I would like regarding the author, but I didn't find any name
into program (research done by using HEX, great N. Salmoria, a man of
my lands, ie Italy!). I thank you however, dear! Tell me your name...
Never forget to write it everywhere: you have to make the people know who
are you, where you live, what you eat, the name of your dog.
The best way to be known: to be stupid! (wack! I'm laughing of myself)
