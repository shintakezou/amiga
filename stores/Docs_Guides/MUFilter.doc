Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

	I remember when I began to learn assembly language. Because
I think (I believe right) that learning is based on imitation, I used to
type many lines of code already written by others. So it was easier
to understand it. I remember Enigma, an Italian magazine, which
used to publish short assembly sources. One of these was "Il filtro che
uccide" (ricordo bene, amici "enigmatici"?) [The filter that kills; 
do I remember well, aenigmatic friends?; translation by MP, all right
reserved!], an article on intuition, but also useful.

	Remembering "The filter that kills" I wrote MUFilter. In the
same time I was studing on G. Nikl's program to make a tool a commodity.
So MUFilter is born.

MUFilter v1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	MUFilter allows you to control the power-led (and filter) of
Amiga. I wanted to call it "MUPLCTRL" but it is rather uncommon.
When you run it, it shows you its interface: two simple "checkers" (do you
call so these buttons with the tick?)... I don't remember their name!
One of these is ghosted. In fact the Protection feature is not available
yet. Problems with CIA! The first mirrors the state of the power-led.
When you kills MUFilter via Commodity Exchange my program sets the filter
as it was before. Now by clicking on that button (push push) you can
control the power-led, that little light in the night.

	There is another way you can control the filter through. Disabling
and Enabling via CX MUFilter when you keep the filter in a different
state respect the state it was before running MUFilter itself. Try to
understand...

	That's all. Never forget: all my programs are Freeware, or, if
specified, PD (Freeware overcome PD if there are declarations in contrast),
but I would be happy if you send me something ... postcard or what...
Why not?

	ATTENTION: I know words like these above need a public space, not
in a documentation of a single program, where you can not read it if you
hate the program... so please spread it! Why not? Be serious, Mauro!
I declared what I declared in the public space (read me). There it lay,
the Truth is over there...... 

	I am saying non-sense words.......... why not?

	Thanks to CS for "why not".
