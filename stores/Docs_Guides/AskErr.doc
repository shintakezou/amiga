	It requires OS2.0+.

	Often it is happened you read on your console something
like "Error 205". And you: "what is error 205?". Several programs
also for old OS1.3 was written to overcome this problem. They kept
all the strings error messages in their code as data. These programs
were rather long and not useful for the future: in fact now there are
new errors, eg the errors which deal with ReadArgs.
But the Operating System 2.0 is almost wonderful: in it now appear
the error strings you need, and easy dos function give you the
string or print it.... So AskErr is born.

	You can use it only form CLI, the argument is simply the number
of the error. And the game is over.
