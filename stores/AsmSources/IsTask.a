; $VER: IsTask.a v1.0 (1996-12-10) by Mauro Panigada
;
; STARTED: 1996-12-10
; FINISHED: 1996-12-10
;
; PURPOSE: To know if a task exists with that name. It is only an
;   example, whose code I will use for a possible more serious program,
;   which monitors alloc/free mem for a particular task/process.
;
; NOTE: Unuseful. Need OS2.04 or upper...
; COMMENT AFTER TEST: Work well but not as I hoped. If you put
;   taskname=input.device, it is exists, but if you use a name of a
;   "normal" process, result is nothing. I tried to use Artm (shareware
;   unregistered version) to pass the name it write in "TASKS". Nothing.
